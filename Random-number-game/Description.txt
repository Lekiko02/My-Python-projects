This program is a number guessing game. 
The player first sets an upper limit by entering a number, and the game then randomly selects a number within the range from 0 to that limit. 
The player's goal is to guess the correct number. After each guess, the game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low. 
The game continues until the player guesses the correct number, and it then displays the number of attempts made.
